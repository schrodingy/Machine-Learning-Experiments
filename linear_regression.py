'''
The linear regression method, as described in Stanford CS229, is equivalent to the
iterative methods for solving linear systems as described in Chapter 7 of
Numerical Methods by Ascher and Grief. In particular, the gradient descent methods
described are equivalent, although CS229 does not cover conjugate gradient descent.
